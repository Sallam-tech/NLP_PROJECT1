# 🔍 Plagiarism Detector (NLP)  

*A Natural Language Processing tool to identify text similarity and potential plagiarism.*  

## 📌 Overview  
This project leverages NLP techniques to:  
- Compare text documents for semantic similarity  
- Detect copied/paraphrased content using *cosine similarity* (or other methods you used)  
- Generate similarity scores with visual reports  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
 
- *Backend:* Python  
- *Frontend:* CCS/HTML  

## 🚀 Key Features  
✔ Preprocessing (tokenization, stemming/lemmatization)  
✔ Vectorization (TF-IDF, embeddings)  
✔ Similarity threshold customization  
  

## 📸 Demo  
```python
# Example usage  
from plagiarism_detector import compare_docs  
similarity_score = compare_docs("doc1.txt", "doc2.txt")  
print(f"Similarity: {similarity_score:.2%}")
